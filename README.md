# Test::DocClaims

A Perl test module to help assure that documentation claims are tested.

A module should have documentation that defines its interface. All claims in
that documentation should have corresponding tests to verify that they are
true. Test::DocClaims is designed to help assure that those tests are written
and maintained.
